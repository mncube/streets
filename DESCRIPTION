Description: Let a billboard-way be a road transport system where streets are 
    arranged as a 2D lattice grid, with cars assigned a path through the grid, 
    starting at the origin and ending at the destination. Let a standard path 
    through a billboard-way follow a Manhattan Path, as described in Chartrand, 
    Polimeni, and Zhang (2017, ISBN: 9780134746753). Each intersection in a 
    billboard-way features one billboard. The streets package offers combinatorial 
    tools for calculating paths on 2D grids, using methods outlined in Blitzstein 
    and Hwang (2019, ISBN: 9781138369917). Additionally, the streets package 
    provides probability functions for billboard impressions in a billboard-way.
